# Project Retrospective

Letâ€™s take a few minutes as a class and capture as many insights possible in the categories below.  One of the instructional team will go through each category and capture as many thoughts as possible.  We ask that you come off mute and speak your thoughts out loud for everyone to hear. 

## Lessons Learned / Accomplishments

> What lessons did you learn during this project? What really wowed us when we learned them?

- console.log(everything)
- Listen to kenny
- Commit often! why? because things can go wrong.. sometimes we lose code. commits save your life
  - branching for features! 
- use Tokens! space and use them wisely... but use them!!
- Planning! 
  - Following the react architecture
- Working with peers, developing enriching connections
- Reading the docs! 
  - API docs! 
  - deployment limitations? (possibles CORS)
- deploy early!
- Prep a new API key just in case. 
- Googling what it is that you need
- SCSS / SASS + react components
  - plain css is outdated
- CONTENTFUL! - headless CMS 
- Refactoring code/ deleting code that doesn't make sense
- Components are islands!
- keyboard shortcuts!
- take breaks from js and style
  - take breaks from styling and work on logic
- back up plan for everything

## Problem Areas

> What areas of the project did you struggle with most? 

- Forms!
- Array methods
- URL params 
  - headers
- Reusing existing components
- Conditional Rendering
- WHERE TO PUT STATE
- Routing is weird. 
- deployment !
- Messy code
- APIs:
  - an Object of Objects
- Figuring out APIs
- Mobile interactivity 
- infinite loops in react
- **search()** functionality => filtering the API
- useMemo(?)

## Future Directions

> Based on lessons learned, and your problem areas, how will you adjust your learning/studying/project planning going into the next unit?

- Project Plan more x 8 people said this
- Break it first, then figure it out
- Use tokes
- Don't spend more than 2 hours MAX on a problem
- Start early. 
- Break down the problem into small pieces
  - how do we eat an elephant?
    - one bite at a time. 
- update your project worksheet
- logic first, and styling later
- tutorials, documentation
`Don't be afraid to come up with an idea that seems near impossible because even if you don't reach your goal, you'll still have created something impressive`
- Have more confidence in my capabilities. There is always an instructor or classmate (or google) to help you when you are stuck.
- Pseudo-pseudocode. Write/type what I want to do in plain English, then put it into pseudocode, then code.
